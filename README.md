quiz-tribos
===========

This is a proof-of-concept project by [Guilherme Berger](https://github.com/gberger42) and [Jo√£o Vicente](https://github.com/KoJoVe). We are using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) to show a quiz to the user, which in the end tells the user which "urban tribe" he is part of. Upon finishing the quiz, the user's answers, along with their [session.js](https://github.com/codejoust/session.js) dump, are sent to a [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) databased hosted by [https://mongolab.com/home](MongoLab). Later, the amassed results can be used to perform statistical analysis.
